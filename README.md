## Predictive Housing Value Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the Predictive Housing Value Analysis project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a bayesian analysis of housing data, aiming to predict median house values with an advanced predictive model.

Key Features

- **Bayesian Regression Modeling:** Developed a precise Bayesian regression model in R using the `rstanarm` library for accurate house value prediction.

- **Data Transformation:** Led effective data preprocessing, converting variables, and introducing impactful features like `rooms_per_bedroom` to enhance model predictive capabilities.

- **Model Evaluation:** Expertly compared Bayesian regression with other models, conducting robust cross-validation for accuracy assessment.

## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates my expertise in data transformation, and model evaluation, showcasing a holistic approach to real-world problem-solving.
